  <h1>Overwatch Rule Violations</h1>

  <p>Since there's only one admin at the moment, and a relatively small community, you may think that our rules will
  differ from the ones over at TF2Stadium.
  They won't.
  I'm enforcing the same rules, but the difference is, I'm the only one making decisions. Believe me, I won't go out of
  my way to harrass users, but if you consistently act like an asshole to other users, you'll be banned or suspended,
  according to the guidelines below.</p>

  <p>Rule violations after the third offense or situations that
  require extra attention are escalated to an Admin Committee that may
  determine to proceed as they feel necessary.</p>

  <h2>Staff Structure</h2>

  <p>We have 3 different levels of staff: Trial Moderator, Moderator,
  and Administrator. Each of these three have access to slightly
  different sets of tools. Trial Moderators can ban a user up to 1
  week, Moderators can ban up to 1 month, and Administrators can ban
  up to 3 months. Any bans beyond that can only be given out by a
  committee of Administrators that meet regularly.</p>

  <h2>Appeal Process</h2>

  <p>Our staff are human and humans make mistakes sometimes. We
  realize this and take our appellate process just as seriously as our
  moderation. If you believe you were punished unjustly and wish to
  appeal, follow the stickied instructions in our Ban Appeals
  Forum.</p>

  <p>If you believe a staff member is abusing their power, please
  message a Moderator or an Administrator you feel comfortable talking
  to. We treat cases of staff abuse with the utmost seriousness and
  will take all action necessary to stop such activities. However
  please realize that it is impossible for any staff to always take
  action in a way that all parties feel is fair or even is objectively
  fair.</p>

  <h2>Questions, Comments, and Feedback</h2>

  <p>If you have any questions, issues, or concerns with our rules or
  how we handle rule violations, please post in our Rules, Questions,
  and Feedback Forum or contact a staff member.</p>
