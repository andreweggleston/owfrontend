# FAQ

## What is OverwatchStadium?

OverwatchStadium is a reskin of TF2Stadium to organize Overwatch
12-mans.

## How will people join the server?

For the time being, Blizzard requires a "game leader" to invite
everyone. In OverwatchStadium, this task will be on the leader of the
lobby. Overwatch allows for players to be added by their battle.net ID,
and the lobby leader can use this to add the players. It might be a lot
of work, but at the current time, there is no other way to do it. I'm 
investigating the possibility of having a bot that invites people and
then puts itself in spectator, but I'm having trouble hooking into the
Overwatch.exe program.

## How did the project begin?

I wanted to organize 12 mans, and wanted to expand the pug community.

## What are lobbies?

Lobbies are semi-organised games between two teams of players in a
mock-competitive environment. In overwatch, each team will always have
6 players, and the lobby leader can choose to enforce either a "Casual"
league environment (more than 1 of each hero allowed), or a
"Competitive" league environment, which only allows 1 of each hero to
be picked at a time. This can be configured in the custom game settings.

## Can I leave a game in progress?

It's not nice to do, but at the moment there isn't a way to invite a
player to a game in progress using the Overwatch custom game option,
so you'll be leaving a game with no chance of having a sub fill your
place. Players can also choose to report you to an admin and you will
recieve a cooldown for consecutive matches left.
