# OverwatchStadium Mission Statement

Created in one week, OverwatchStadium is a reskin of [TF2Stadium](http://tf2stadium.com).
([I'm](https://steamcommunity.com/id/ilovelange)) its sole dev, and
I provide all of the hosting from a linux box in my basement. Hard work,
I tell you.

Feel free to fork the project [on github](https://github.com/tiggger/OverwatchStadium.git)

I made a [steam
group](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/OverwatchStadium) too! If you
have any questions, feel free to comment there. I'll be checking it as
much as I can.
